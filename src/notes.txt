This file is just a notes file to ensure the project is build on track

1. Summary of the system :

Objective :

To build an application that can manage car sharing capabilities.

System must allow users to participate in a ride-sharing journey along a
specific path.

Option :
    1. Join the driver in the journey
    2. Join the passenger on the journey

There may be multiple trips from the starting and the end point.
user may choose from the list of trips.

Must have a registration Service -> to register the user ( driver/passenger )
Must have a vehicle registration service ->

User must be able to propose a trip

Strategy : can ride themselves or for another person


Model :
0. User
1. Driver
2. Passenger
3. Vehicle
4. Trip

Repo Layer:

Here we are implementing using the HashMap in actual you have to use a
db

Also note in this layer only focus on the operations that a DB would do

Saving Entry
Retrieval of Entry


Note : While saving of the user the ID which should to be given to all
classes, this must be filled in by the DB/Repository layer

Here since we are using a repo layer,so we have to put a static variable local to
that class which we can increment while registering a new user and this same
can be set to the id of the entity we are saving.


1. Passenger Repo
2. Driver Repo
3. Vehicle Repo
4. Trip Repo


Service Layer : Holds the business logic

1. User Service Layer :

This will hold the business logic. Here I have created two separate services
for the Driver and Passenger.

DriverService
PassengerService
VehicleService

Controller Layer : This talks to the front end and the back end.

DriverController
PassengerController
VehicleController
